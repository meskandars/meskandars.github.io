I'm currently a PhD student at Northeastern University under supervision of professor <a href='https://mllabneu.github.io'>Jennifer Dy</a>. I'm working on theoretical machine learning as well as applications of machine learning for skin cancer melanoma diagnosis. 
I am currently working on adversarial robustness of deep learning methods as well as continual/lifelong learning. I'm also interested in domain adaptation, federated learning, self-supervised learning. In the past, I've also worked on explainble ai, specifically the attribution of deep neural networks.
